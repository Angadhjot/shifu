Shifu Change Log

Changes for Shifu-0.2.4
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/20: Work flow change.
        a) Old: new -> init -> stats -> varselect -> normalize -> train -> eval
        b) New: new -> init -> stats -> normalize -> varselect -> train -> eval
        c) If do variable selection again after a model, current work flow no need do normalize step, after variable selection then do training step.
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/49: Add distributed sensitivity analysis variable selection.
        a) 'varSelect.wrapperEnabled=true' and 'wrapperBy=SE' in ModelConfig.json#varSelect part to enable sensitivity variable selection.
        b) 'wrapperRatio' in ModelConfig.json#varSelect part is a percent to set how many variables will be removed.
        c) To continue variable selection by sensitivity method, run 'shifu varselect' again. 
        d) With 20 million of records and 1600 variables, 70 minutes (45 minutes for 200 epoch training and 25 minutes for sensitivity variable selection).
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/38: Improve scalability in stats step.
        a) 'binningAlgorithm=SPDT' (default value) in ModelConfig.json#stats is to do variable statistics to improve scalability for big data.
            Using SPDT, with 20 million of records and 1600 variables, 50 minutes to finish variable selection.
        b) 'binningAlgorithm=MunroPat' in ModelConfig.json#stats is another approach to do variable statistics to improve scalability for big data.
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/58: Improve scalability in eval step for HDFS mode.
        a) With 20 million of records and 1600 variables, 20 minutes to finish eval step with only 1GB driver memory.
    * https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/61: Embeded zookeeper server support.
        a) No need to set zookeeper servers so far since embeded zookeeper server will help on training models.
        b) Big data training, independent zookeeper cluster is strongly recommended.
        c) Upgrade Guagua to 0.5.0 to get support from Guagua for this feature.
    * Add PMML standard model converter.
    * Bug fix:
        a) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/45
        b) https://github.com/ShifuML/shifu/issues/51

Changes for Shifu-0.2.0
    * Make Shifu to support Hadoop-2.0 (add -Phdp-yarn when building)
    * Show mapper progress in JobTracker and show progress in CLI when using distribute training 
    * Validation rate = 0% is permit. In that case, save when train error goes down
    * Generate better default ModelConfig, and create empty files for some configuration
    * Refactor integration API - add static Normalizer.normalize(), simplify constructor of ModelRunner, and allow load models by path
    * [Test] add support for decision-tree
    * Enhance shifu script to make it support Hadoop1 and Hadoop2 smoothly
    * Add new info for ColumnConfig: missing, total, missingPercentage, binWeightedPos and binWeightedNeg
    * Update the layout of EvalPerformance.json
    * Add version number in ModelConfig, ColumnConfig and EvalPerformance

Changes for Shifu-0.1.1
    * Use gradient aggregation to improve distributed training model performance
    * Fix the bug when sorting the model results
    * Fix the bug - The sourceMetaColumnFile couldn't be read when using mapred + HDFS to run evaluation
    * Hidden custom path in ModelConfig, since most users won't change them
    * Add meta column names in file header, when using `mapred` to run evaluation
    
Changes for Shifu-0.1.0
    * Refactor the item names in ModelConfig to make it follow http://10.9.187.2/project/agreement/
    * Move zookeeperServers, hadoopNumParallel, hadoopJobQueue, localNumParallel into ${SHIFU_HOME}/conf/shifuconfig
    * Enable customized path for ModelSet and modelsPath,scorePath,performancePath,confusionMatrixPath in Eval
    * Comment out storing normalized data when using MapReduce to run evaluation
    
Changes for Shifu-0.0.4
    * Add distributed nn implementation based on hadoop mapreduce job.
        a). To trigger distributed nn, set 'runMode' to 'pig';
        b). For distributed nn, please provide your own 'zkServers' of 'train' group.
        c). You can set 'epochsPerIteration' which means in each iteration how many iterations will be executed. 
    * Eval refactor.
        a). Add -score -confmat -perf options for eval command
        b). Add "scoreColumn" option in ModelConfig.json to get the target score
        c). Add "modelsPath" "scorePath" "confusionMatrixPath" "performancePath" options in ModelConfig.json
        d). Change "metricColumnName" to "weightedColumn"
    * TA457512 - Fix the bug: the delimiter of evaluation data doesn't take effect in AKKA mode
    * TA458788 - Fix the bug: Meta validation fails to report error when - "NumHiddenNodes" : [ "a", 45 ]
    * TA459375 - Write in-place QuickSort to replace Collections.sort() for memory consumption
	

Changes for Shifu-0.0.3
    * TA446629 - Fix the bug: when there is am empty file, shifu in akka mode will be stucked
    * TA446631 - Fix the bug: user can't use \t to split data in pig mode
    * TA446678 - Fix the bug: when user create a new model and the model already exists, the log still shows the model is created successfully
    * TA447772 - Fix the bug: when sync data from local to HDFS, the evaluation directory are in wrong place
    * TA449606 - Fix the bug: the filter expression logic is opposite just as design
    * TA449907 - Fix the bug: ignore those records whose value is not numerical while columnType is N in `shifu stats`
    * TA449910 - Fix the bug: the fixInitInput doesn't work in model training
    * TA451113 - Fix the bug: the calculating stats step consume more memory than before

    * TA457490 - Fix the bug: evaluation data couldn't use different delimiter in AKKA mode
    * DE30848 - hdfs + akka mode, 4g memory for 200m data but got OOM at stats step
    * DE30836 - Non-existing target column might be better to be validated at init step
    * DE30915 - disable the forceSelected option but still got the validation error
    * DE30916 - Add forceRemove file at varselect step leads to Target column be covered by ForceRemove flag
    * DE30922 - LearningRate cannot cast int to double
    * DE30467 - The old model files should be cleaned up before training.
